# JavaScript excercise

## Display users and their details using remote API
Using JavaScript display list of users.
On selecting user from the list display its details.

## Form
Display form - up to you. Its minor for this excercise. We want to check yours JavaScript skills, not styling.
Libraries you'll use - up to you. But try to be kind and use `fetch` to retreive data :)

## Data: Users endpoint

* list: `https://isa-simple-rest-api.herokuapp.com/api/users`
* details: `https://isa-simple-rest-api.herokuapp.com/api/users/{id}`, where `id` is id of the user
